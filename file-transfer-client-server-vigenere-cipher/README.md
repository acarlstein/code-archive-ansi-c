# File Transfer Client and Server using Vigenere Cipher from 2010

## Disclaimer

This code is provided for educational purposes, you are responsible of how you use this code and this code is provided 'as is'. Meaning that I do not take responsibility of  any harm that this code may or not produce]

The following is an example of a client and server that let you transfer a file from the client to the server by encrypting and then decrypting the packages using Vigenere Cipher.

## Note: 

This program is designed only to send files that are alphabetic in lower case, without spaces, and  only one line.

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzaabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzaabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza

As a good policy, always add your name, short description, and any other information that could help a user that doesn't know as you the content of your code and its behaviour.

## Note

In the server, there must be a subdirectory named cli_serv in which ssh and scp can access after loading.

Default file is required for both the server and the client. It holds the libraries and definitions shared by both programs.

The following is the code for the server: serv.c.

The following is the code for the client: cli.c.

When I wrote the code, I was following certain guidelines. As you may think the code could be written better. I agree.

In case you have any questions about the code please post them. I will try to answer you as soon as possible.
