# Example of using Fork and pipe in Linux from 2010

The following program will create a chain of parents/child in which the last child will receive a message form the top parent through a pipe.

NOTIFICATION: These examples are provided for educational purposes. Using this code is under your own responsibility and risk. The code is given ‘as is’. I do not take responsibilities of how they are used.

The first example is without using recursion while the second example is the same thing but using example. In this way, you can see how fork and pipe behaves.
